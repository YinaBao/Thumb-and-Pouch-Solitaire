# Thumb-and-Pouch-Solitaire

This game is a variant of “Klondike” (http://politaire.com/help/klondike) solitaire, but easier.
Klondike was probably the best known version of solitaire world-wide. For many people,
Klondike, with its triangular tableau and alternating colors, is the canonical game of solitaire. It
dates back to at least 1912 when it was included in the Mary Whitmore Jones collection with
the name "Small Triangle". Microsoft has added to its popularity by including a version of
Klondike called "Windows Solitaire" in every version of its operating system since Windows 3.0.
As said, the “Thumb and Pouch” solitaire is an easier game than Klondike, as because the cards
can be played on tableau cards of any different suit.

The best way to understand this game is to play it. You can play this game here
http://politaire.com/thumbandpouch. We suggest you to play this game couple of times, so
that you can plan your program effectively. The interesting thing about this game is you can win
almost every time if you play it carefully.
All the top 4 piles are called “Foundations”, the seven vertical piles are called as “Tableau”, the
piles on the bottom-left that are faced down are called “Stock” and the piles on the right
(faced-up) are called “Waste”. The goal of the game is to arrange all the cards into Foundations
such that they are sorted according to 4 different suits and ranked from Ace to King.


#### Game Rules:
* Cards: One standard deck of 52 cards.
* Goal: Move all cards to the foundation.
* Foundation: Four foundation piles. Any ace may be moved to any empty pile in the
foundation. A card may be added onto a foundation pile if it is one higher than the old
top card of the pile and of the same suit. Thus, the only card that could be played on a
Q♣ would be a K♣. Once on the foundation, cards cannot be moved back off.
* Tableau: Seven tableau piles with one card in the first pile, two cards in the second,
three in the third, and so on. Therefore, there will be 28 cards on the tableau. The top
card in each pile is dealt face up, all others are face down. The last card on each column
is the top card. A card may be added onto a tableau pile if it is one lower than the old
top card of the pile and of a different suit. Thus, the cards that could be played on J♦
would be 10♠, 10♥ or 10♣. Cards on the tableau that are not under another card are
available for play onto the foundation or any other tableau pile. Empty spaces in the
tableau may be filled by any card. Groups of cards in sequence down may be moved
from one tableau column to another if no two consecutive cards are of the same suit.
* Stock and Waste: The remaining cards (i.e. 24 cards) form the stock and there is one
waste pile. Each time you draw a card from the stock, the card will be placed on to the
waste. Only one pass through the Stock is permitted. Only the top card of the waste is
available for play to the tableau or the foundation.
